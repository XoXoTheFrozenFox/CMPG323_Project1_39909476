<font color="red">REPOSITORIES:</font>

This repository will be used for Project 1.

All the other projects from 2-5 will have a separate repository created using a naming convention as follows: "CMPG323 <project_number> - <student_number>".
Therefore:

Project2: "CMPG323_Project2_39909476"

Project3: "CMPG323_Project3_39909476"

Project4: "CMPG323_Project4_39909476"

Project5: "CMPG323_Project5_39909476"

If code from the previous repositories is needed, it will be copied over to the relevant repository.

DIAGRAM_REPRESENTATION:

This diagram illustrates the integration between the projects and their respective repository contexts:

There are no lines that indicate integration between repositories because of code being moved as needed.

BRANCHING:

Project1:

Doesn't need a branch because of the project being administrive and more of a detailing for the project.

Project2-5:

MAIN: Each project will have a main branch. Commonly referred to as the "master" branch, is a critical branch in version control systems like Git. It serves as the default branch that represents the latest stable version of the project's codebase. The main branch typically contains the most up-to-date and production-ready code that is free of any major bugs or issues.

TESTING: This branch serves as a dedicated environment for testing new technologies, untraditional optimization strategies, or any other ideas proposed by the project team that they are unsure about. It provides a safe space to conduct experiments and validate these changes before integrating them into the main system. The purpose of this branch is to mitigate risks, foster innovation, and facilitate collaboration among team members. It allows for thorough testing, learning from each other's experiments, and making informed decisions about the suitability of these changes for the project. Successful experiments can be selectively integrated into the main system, while unsuccessful ones can be refined or discarded based on the insights gained during the testing phase.

BUG: This branch is utilized when the code encounters issues or doesn't function as intended. It serves as a safety net to preserve progress at the end of the day. By creating this branch, developers can safeguard their work and experiment with different approaches. If needed, they can easily roll back to a previous version in the main branch to try alternative solutions or fix the problems.

DEVELOPMENT: : This branch primarily serves as the main development area for working on specific features. It is where the majority of code is written, thoroughly tested, and refined. Once everything functions correctly and is deemed stable, the code is merged into the main branch. The DEVELOPMENT branch allows for focused and iterative development, ensuring that changes are thoroughly validated before being integrated into the main codebase.
