# CMPG_323_OVERVIEW_39909476

This repository will be used for Project 1.
All the other projects from 2-5 will have a separate repository created using a naming convention as follows: "CMPG323 <project_number> - <student_number>".
Therefore:
Project2: "CMPG323_Project2_39909476"
Project3: "CMPG323_Project3_39909476"
Project4: "CMPG323_Project4_39909476"
Project5: "CMPG323_Project5_39909476"
If code from the previous repositories is needed, it will be copied over to the relevant repository.
